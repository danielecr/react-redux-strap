# React redux and redux-observable boilerplate

A minimal package to start to develop a React application with redux
and redux-observable support.

## Quickstart

> npm i

To install, then run with:

> npm run start

## Produce a single target bundle `.js` file

There is no support for manifest, and neither for webworker.

The only built file is a `index.bundle.js` in `dist/` folder
